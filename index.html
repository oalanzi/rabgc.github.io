  <h1>Welcome to Rick Bennett's Homepage on GitHub</h1>

  <p> I am a Professor at the University of Arizona in the Department of Geosciences. Much of my time is dedicated to teaching and conducting research in the fields of Geodesy and Geophysics. Want to know more about these fields? Send me an <a href="mailto:tectorab@gmail.com">email</a>. </p>

  <p> In my spare time I like to travel, cook, play the drums with my rock band, and hang out with my family. I also like to play with my computer. Who doesn't?</p>

  <p> You can find out a little more about who I am and what I do by following the <a href="/about">About</a> and <a href="/cv">CV<a/> links above. You might even find a blog entry or two by following the <a href="/blog">Blog</a> link. </p>
