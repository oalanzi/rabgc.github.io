  <h1>Welcome to Rick Bennett's Homepage on GitHub</h1>

  <p> I am a Professor at the University of Arizona in the Department of Geosciences. Much of my time is dedicated to teaching and conducting research in the field of Satellite Geodesy. Want to know more about Geodesy? Send me an <a href="mailto:tectorab@gmail.com">email</a>. In my spare time I like to travel, play the drums with my rock band, and hang out with my family. I also like to play with my computer. Who doesn't?</p>

  <p> A little more information about who I am and what I do may be also found by following the <a href="/about">About</a> and <a href="/cv">CV<a/> links above. You might even find a blog entry or two by following the <a href="/blog">Blog</a> link. </p>
