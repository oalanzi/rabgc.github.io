	<h1>Rick Bennett</h1>
	<p> I am a professor at the University of Arizona in the Department of Geosciences. My students and I are interested in monitoring and analyzing the changing shape and gravity field of our planet over the widest possible range of spatial and temporal scales. We promote scientific investigation through inclusive, accessible research, education, and mentoring. </p>
