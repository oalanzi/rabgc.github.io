<h1>About Rick Bennett</h1>
<p> Confucious said something like this: "choose a job you love, and you will never work a day in your life". I think he was failry accurate on this topic; but beware, when you are passionate about your work, it can be hard to separate what you do from who you are. Whatever. </p>

 <p> I am a professor at the University of Arizona in the Department of Geosciences. And I love what I do. My students and I use signals from Earth orbiting satellites to monitor and analyze the changing shape our planet. Yes, people do that. Its a field called Geodesy. It feels kind of cool to study something a little bit out of the ordinary. </p>

 <p> My interest in research and teaching  originated from a desire to increase understanding of natural hazards and their underlying processes. What can I say, I grew up in southern California earthquake country. I've spent a fair amount of time installing high-precision GPS instruments to measure motions of Earth's surface in Argentina, Croatia, Iceland, Italy, among others. I've seen some fantastically remote and spectacular regions along the way. But over the years, I have developed an interest in the use of technologies to increase inclusiveness and accessibility in research, education, and elsewhere. Its the 21st century.  We now have Earth orbiting satellites and ground based instruments recording petabytes of data, and publicly available data archives and Internet communications for immediate gratification. Data science software tools and other assistive technologies make analyses of these large data sets flat out fun. The potential applications to Geoscience and other fields of scientifc investigation are endless. There's so just much we can do now while sipping capuccino at an Italian caf√©. You can call it work or you can call it play. Either way is fine by me. </p>
