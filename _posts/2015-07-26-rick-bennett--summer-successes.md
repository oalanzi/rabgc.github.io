I was sitting at a cafe in front of the Pantheon in Rome last month, sipping on a beverage that would have cost me half were I not sitting at a cafe in front of the Pantheon.  It was worth it of course. After all, I was sitting in front of the Pantheon.  And the beverage allowed me to ask the cameriere for a WiFi password. As I took in the ambiance of Rome, I connected to the WiFi and promptly downloaded Pope Francis' new encyclical to my iPhone. I began to read the Pope's message, in short that we should, as humans, take care of the Earth rather than destroy it. Huh, pretty cool pope this one is. (Earlier that day I had visited Campo de' Fiori, where a statue stands in memory of Giordano Bruno. He was burned at the stake in 1600, having been found guilty of heresy by the Inquisition.) Anyway, I said to myself: "Here I am, sitting in front of the Pantheon reading an encyclical about our moral obligation to stop trashing Earth from an iPhone." Sometimes you just have to say things before the weight of them sinks in. Meanwhile, a distant street performer lovingly squeezed the theme song from The Godfather out of his accordion, as he somehow held his ground against the ebb and flow of tidal currents arising within the sea of tourists. It was just one of those moments.
